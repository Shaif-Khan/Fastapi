🚀 I BUILT A SECURE USER & CLIENT API SERVICE SYSTEM USING FASTAPI!

Hello connections! 👋

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a robust and scalable API backend system that handles user and client service with secure authentication and database integration.

Here’s what makes it powerful:

🔧 Tech Stack:
FastAPI – Lightning-fast async Python web framework
Microsoft SQL Server – Reliable enterprise-grade database
SQLAlchemy + pyodbc – ORM integration
JWT Authentication – Secure login and token handling
Pydantic – Clean data validation and type checking

🛡️ Authentication & Security:
✅ User login/signup with JWT-based authentication
 ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt via Passlib
 ✅ Role-based access control (optional)
 ✅ ✅ Email Verification Flow – Sends a verification link to users before activating the account 🔗✉️

🔁 CRUD Functionalities:
✔️ GET – Retrieve user/client details
 ✔️ POST – Create new users/clients
 ✔️ PUT – Update records
 ✔️ DELETE – Remove users/clients

🧰 Core Features:
Modular routing: auth, users, clients
Separate request & response models for clean architecture
Auto-generated API Docs at /docs (Swagger UI) and /redoc (ReDoc)
Designed for scalability and clean codebase separation
